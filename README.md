# Messy Lab

The primary goal for Messy Lab is to provide an intuitive environment for the students of Computer Sciences and Software Engineering, where they can safely and comfortably learn the basics of Assembly programming. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and immediately familiar to anyone who used one of the more popular development environments before.
