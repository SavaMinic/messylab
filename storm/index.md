### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

> **Microsoft** – Software Engineer

*May 2012 – present*

Delivered core improvements on the next-generation **SQL Server** in-memory MVCC database engine, **Hekaton**. Had a key role in expanding the lock free transaction processing mechanism to support interleaved nested transaction. The solution is currently patent-pending. This enabled a top-requested user scenario: Multiple Active Result Sets. Implemented natively compiled stored procedure support for Check and Foreign Key Constraints.

Development of the shared-nothing distributed RDBMS engine, SQL Server **Parallel Data Warehouse** (PDW). Helped deliver Transparent Data Encryption by leading the effort to utilize AES-NI instructions in SQL Server to increase performance. Extended Distributed-SQL language surface area by implementing features such as error handling and intrinsics. Added PDW connectivity to **Visual Studio** tooling.

Developed a set of PowerShell scripts to facilitate quick deployment of a **Hadoop** cluster (including Hive, Pig, H Base, etc.) on a set of local or Azure VMs for development purposes. With a seven minute deployment time on the desktop, increased team productivity significantly.

> **Vast.com** – Core Software Engineer

*March 2011 – May 2012*

Lead redesign and reimplementation effort of **Vast Data Framework**, a JSON and Avro based serialization framework used throughout the company’s infrastructure. Through the use of Maven-integrated code generation it provides efficient and convenient data access.

Took part in implementation of various features and worked on improving the overall architecture of **VastDB**, a No SQL solution based on a *dbm*-like key value store and Hadoop, dubbed a “streaming database.”
Completely redesigned and expanded the feature set of **VastComm**, a Netty based communications library that greatly simplifies implementing network interfaces such as HTTP or Avro for internal REST services.

> **Softplus Design** – Founder

*Part time 2003 – 2010*

Founded the company during the 3rd year of High School as a family business. Designed and implemented an end to end solution for Sports Bookmakers. Responsibilities included understanding user scenarios, UI design, software architecture and implementation, including the internal tools used to provide continuous data updates to customers.
