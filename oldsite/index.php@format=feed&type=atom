		<summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Messy Lab is an free, open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Assembly Languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The primary goal for Messy Lab is to provide an intuitive environment for the students of Computer Sciences and Software Engineering, where they can safely and comfortably learn the basics of Assembly programming. The interface is designed to be user-friendly and immediately familiar to anyone who used one of the more popular development environments before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing a familiar surrounding, Messy Lab allows its users to focus on the challenges of the assembly programming itself, instead of wasting the effort on getting used to hostile-seeming environments provided by some of the other assembler development solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
